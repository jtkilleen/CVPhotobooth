#CVPhotobooth

Hello all!
This is a photobooth that uses computer vision to put objects on people's faces.

## How To Use
1. Stand a couple feet back from the camera and a hat should be drawn on you.
2. Clicking on the screen will toggle sunglasses on your face.
3. Finally, pressing `q` will take a snapshot and end the program.

## Known Bugs
* The hat isn't exactly center on the person's face.
* If you get too close to the camera then the program crashes.
